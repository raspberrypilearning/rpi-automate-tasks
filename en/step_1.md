## What you will make

Make your Raspberry Pi play a cheerful sound automatically at startup and at regular intervals.
This is particularly useful when it is running headless!
Completing this project does not alter anything else on your Raspberry Pi.

### You will need
- Speakers or headphones

If you do not have speakers or headphones, then you can try our [Automate tasks on your Raspberry Pi - LED](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-automate-tasks-led/){:target="_blank"} project.
